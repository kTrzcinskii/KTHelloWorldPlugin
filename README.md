## Installation

## Usage
To use this plugin you should open `Search Everywhere` (by default it's **double-shift** shortcut). Then you should look for `Hello World` action and choose it.

![Search for "Hello World" in Search Everywhere](examples/search_everywhere_hello_world.png)

The Hello World Dialog should open and you should see something like this:

When you are done with greeting the World you can click "OK", which closes the dialog. Feel free to use it as many times a day as you like :).
